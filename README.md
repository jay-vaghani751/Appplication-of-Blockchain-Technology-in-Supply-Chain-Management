# Application-of-Blockchain-Technology-in-Supply-Chain-Management

This project is intended to be used with the
[Hardhat Beginners Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial), but you should be
able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its
`contracts`, `tests`, `scripts` and `frontend` directories.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate.git
cd hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail. 
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## Conclusion

With its distributed ledger technology, which provides an open, unchangeable record of transactions that is freely accessible by all relevant parties, blockchain can address these supply chain management concerns. Smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that are placed on the blockchain, can help to boost transparency, traceability, and efficiency across a supply chain. They can be used to track the movement of items across a supply chain, determine provenance, provide transparent credentialing and reputation management, and automatically execute payments. This helps supply chain partners create trust and saves time and cost inefficiencies associated with overlapping effort and additional verification processes. Because real-time data can be used to assist decision-making, it also speeds up the supply chain and makes it more agile in handling risks and interruptions.
